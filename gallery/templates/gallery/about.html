                <h2>Welcome to My World of Art</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Ayan</strong>, an artist passionate about bringing creativity to life.  
                My journey in the world of art started from a young age, and over the years, I have honed my skills in various art forms.  
                I specialize in <strong>portrait painting</strong>, capturing emotions with depth and realism.  
                My favorite medium is <strong>acrylic painting on canvas</strong>, where I explore vibrant colors and bold strokes.  
                I also enjoy the simplicity and elegance of <strong>pencil sketching</strong>, which allows me to express intricate details with precision.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond painting, I have a deep love for arts and crafts, where I experiment with different materials and textures.  
                My goal is to create art that inspires and connects with people on an emotional level.  
                Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope my artwork brings you joy and inspiration!</p>
